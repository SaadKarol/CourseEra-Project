                         Canada is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from
                        the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million
                        square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest 
                        country by total area. Its southern and western border with the United States, 
                        stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest bi-national land border. 
                        Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, 
                        Montreal, and Vancouver. Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada
                        for thousands of years.
